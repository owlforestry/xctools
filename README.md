IosBox
======

IosBox is collection of Rake Tasks that makes developing iOS apps more easy.
It includes rake tasks that take care of updating app Info.plist with proper
version information (e.g. build date, GIT hash, etc).
Further version will integrate deployment options, such as deploy beta versions
to TestFlight.

Current Features
----------------

Currently IosBox supports following features:

* <b>Build Prepare</b> (`iosbox:build:prepare`)
  Build prepare task generates new build number and bundle version and stores
  it to application Info.plist.
  It also saves some needed path information to .buildCache for other tasks

* <b>Version Mungle</b> (`iosbox:version:*`)
  IosBox offers simple tasks to bump version numbers. Either it is patch, minor or
  major version bump, IosBox automatically handles increasing current version number.

### Planned Features

In the roadmap are following features (but not yet planned)

* Library adding, such as analytics, Hoptoad, adwhirl, etc.
* Asset management, slicing assets according to receipt etc.
* More to come, open for suggestions...
